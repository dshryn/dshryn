I’m a pre-final year B.Tech IT student at VIT Vellore with a strong interest in cloud computing, backend systems, and cross-platform app development. Over the last couple of years, I’ve worked on projects ranging from mobile apps in Flutter to cloud-native pipelines on AWS, while also gaining hands-on experience with modern backend frameworks.

## 📚 Projects


### [End-to-end Flight Delay ETL & ML Pipeline on AWS](https://github.com/dshryn/etl-pipeline-aws) ☁️

Production-style ETL + ML pipeline that ingests flight-delay CSVs and implements a medallion architecture (Bronze - Silver - Gold) on S3 to enable reliable analytics and inference.

_Highlights:_

- **Medallion architecture:** Bronze - Silver - Gold layers on S3 for incremental refinement, data quality, and easier downstream consumption.  
- **Cost-efficient querying:** Athena CTAS/UNLOAD workflows using Parquet formats and partitioning for fast, low-cost queries.  
- **Modeling & serving:** XGBoost classifier (artifacts stored in S3) and deployed real-time inference via FastAPI, containerized with Docker, with an Nginx frontend on EC2. ([Serverless variant repo](https://github.com/dshryn/serverless-etl-aws)).  
- **Analyst access:** Exposed Gold tables to Power BI via Athena using the ODBC driver for self-service BI and reporting.

Tech Used: AWS S3, Athena, EC2, XGBoost, FastAPI, Docker, Nginx, Power BI (ODBC)
